## Inception of open source EDA, openLANE, sky130
## Day-1 How to talk to computers
### In Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
> The aim of the workshop is to give fundamental overview of chip design. Below image shows the arduino baord, known as FPGA board. Here, we will concentrate on the chip in the board called processor
