## Inception of open source EDA, openLANE, sky130
## Day-1 How to talk to computers
### In Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
> The aim of the workshop is to give fundamental overview of chip design. Below image shows the arduino baord, known as FPGA board. Here, we will concentrate on the chip in the board called processor

> The Arduino bard can be represented in the form of block diagram. As shown below, processor is surrounded by the interfaces like Vcc/GND, SRAM chip, JTAG etc. This is the typical board diagram to design an arduino board.

Inside image of the chip is shown below. It is called as packages.This is particularly QFN-48. Chip is lacated at the centre of the package. CHip is connected to the packages using wire bond.
